This answer was fist posted in the FAQ on the modding Discord ![_]({{ '/assets/images/faq/discord.png' | relative_url }}) [here](https://discord.com/channels/1260111500522295377/1298066504478359592/1343022758216470641).

The easiest and quickest way to solve it is this:
1. Find your mod storage folder (by default it's `C:\Users\<USERNAME>\AppData\Local\Helldivers2ModManager`)
2. Go into the mods folder
3. Delete or move mods out of that folder one at a time and check if the manager is working again
4. Reinstall/move back the working mods
5. Mod Manager should be working good now
