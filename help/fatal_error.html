<p>
	This tends to happen everytime the game receives a major update.
</p>
<p>
	It is a simple problem to solve.
	<br>
	The only reason you'll be getting this error is that you installed a mod that was not updated to work with the most recent version of the game.
	Hence, why it says that your files may be corrupt. Because they are, in a way.
</p>
<p>
	So how do I solve this problem?
</p>
<p>
	The only way is to remove all mods that haven't been updated.
</p>
<p>
	And in cast this wasn't clear, this is <b>not</b> a fault of the manager.
	So please stop reporting bugs of how the manager crashes your game.
	It can't.
