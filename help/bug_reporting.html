title: How to Report a Bug
---
<p class="text-center fs-5">So you found a bug and want to report it? Here's what you need to know.</p>

It should be no secret that I rely on you to report bugs, so I can improve your experience.
<br>
There are two ways to report a bug:
<ol>
	<li>Via <a href="https://github.com/teutinsa/Helldivers2ModManager/issues/new" target="_blank">GitHub</a></li>
	<li>Via <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/helldivers2/mods/109?tab=bugs" target="_blank">NexusMods</a></li>
</ol>

<h3>Do not</h3>
<ul>
	<li>
		Ask for features in a bug report.
		<br>
		Please only use special <a href="https://github.com/teutinsa/Helldivers2ModManager/issues/new" target="_blank">GitHub Issues</a> for that.
	</li>
	<li>
		Ask questions in a bug report.
		<br>
		Please use the dedicated channels
		(<a href="https://discord.com/channels/1260111500522295377/1291153809384542259" target="_blank">Discord</a>,
		<a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/helldivers2/mods/109?tab=posts" target="_blank">NexusMods Posts</a>)
		or have a look at the <a href="{{ '/help/faq.html' | relative_url }}">FAQ</a>.
	</li>
</ul>

<h3>The title</h3>
<p>
	The title is the very first thing I see and will reference multiple times.
	Thus, it needs to describe the core of your issue in a short and sensible fashion.
	<br>
	Pleas do not put the title as "Manager not work", "Program bad", ect.
	This is not helpful at all and I can't improve the tool with that.
</p>

<h3>What to include</h3>
<p>This should go without saying but please don't make the description just your title again.</p>
<p>
	If you are reporting a crash or an error please include the log file in question.
	You will find your logs in the same place where you put your manager executable.
	<br>
	In any case, describe what you were doing up until your issue occurred.
	<br>
	It is very important that you give me every bit of context you can, even if it's mod specific. (I won't judge you)
</p>
<p>
	You don't need to include any contact information.
	GitHub and NexusMods will take care of that.
	I will never ask you for personal information.
	<br>
	Also, you should know better than to post personal information online on demand.
