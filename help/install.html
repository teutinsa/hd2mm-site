	This section covers the installation process of the Mod Manager.
</p>
<p class="text-center fs-6 fw-light">
	If you're here however, I have to assume that you have trouble following the simple 2 steps described on the <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/helldivers2/mods/109?tab=description">NexusMods page</a>.
</p>

<p>
	Alright let's get to it.
</p>
<p>
	First.
	<br>
	Got to the <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/helldivers2/mods/109?tab=description" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">NexusMods page</a> again and pick the version you want.
	The latest is of course recommended.
</p>
<p>
	Good.
	<br>
	Now you should have a <code>zip</code> file in your <img class="d-inline-block" src="{{ '/assets/images/help/downloads.png' | relative_url }}"> downloads folder.
	Extract this files contents anywhere you want.
	Ideally where you'll find it again.
	The location really doesn't matter.
	<br>
	You can put it on your desktop in a folder.
	It is a portable applications meaning it does not need to be installed via a traditional installer.
</p>
<p>
	There you go.
	<br>
	You have "installed" the Mod Manager.
	You may now also want to look into the <a href="{{ '/help/setup.html' | relative_url }}">setup guide</a> since you're already here.
