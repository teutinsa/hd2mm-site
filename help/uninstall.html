	I'm sorry to see you go.

<p>
	To uninstall the manager all you need to do is delete its files where ever you put them.
	Since it's a portable program.
	Running an uninstalling process is not needed.
</p>

	Additionally, if you want to fully get rid of everything you should also delete the storage directory.
