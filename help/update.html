	Is it time to update the manager again?
</p>

<p>
	Updating the manager is simpler than you think.
</p>
All you need to do is:
<ul>
	<li>
		Delete all you old manager files except the <code>settings.json</code> file.
		<br>
		Make sure you don't delete you storage directory.
	</li>
	<li>Download your new desired version.</li>
	<li>Extract the new version into the folder where you <code>settings.json</code> from the old version was.</li>
</ul>
