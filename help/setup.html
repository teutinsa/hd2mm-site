	So you have downloaded your desired version and want to start using it?
	Then this is the section for you!
</p>

<p>
	First of.
	<br>
	If you haven't extracted the <code>zip</code> file you've received form downloading you should take a look at the <a href="{{ '/help/install.html' | relative_url }}">installation guide</a>.
</p>
<p>
	Let's quickly go over what we want to achieve here.
	<br>
	We of course want to get to the point where you can install and use mods.
	But we will also talk about where your mods will be stored and how to change that.
	As well as where mods are staged.
</p>
<p>
	Now you can run the executable.
	<br>
	You will see the window appear after a short time.
	<br>
	Now go to settings.
	<br>
	On the settings page you'll see three text boxes.
	The first one labeled "Game Directory" will be empty.
	This is where you put the path to your Helldivers 2 installation.
	(For steam this would be something like
	<code id="default-path" class="border">C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Helldivers 2</code>
	<button class="btn p-0 px-1" type="button" data-copy-source="#default-path"><img src="{{ '/assets/images/help/copy.png' | relative_url }}" alt="Copy"></button>)
	So go ahead and select where this would be for you.
</p>
So, about the "Storage Directory" and "Temporary Directory".
<br>
<ul>
	<li>
		<b>Storage Directory</b>
		<br>
		This is where the manager will store all mods and other data.
		<br>
		Feel free to change this if you want.
	</li>
	<li>
		<b>Temporary Directory</b>
		<br>
		Like the name says this directory is used for temporary storage.
		Mod files during staging or extracted files when adding mods for example.
		<br>
		It's recommended to leave this as it's default or have it be on an SSD since it will be subject to a lot of read and write events.
	</li>
</ul>
